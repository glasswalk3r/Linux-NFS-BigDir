=head1 NAME

Linux::NFS::BigDir - use Linux getdents syscall to read large directories over NFS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Linux::NFS::BigDir qw(getdents);
    # entries_ref is an array reference
    my $entries_ref = getdents($very_large_dir);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module was created to solve a very specific problem: you have a directory
over NFS, mounted by a Linux OS, and that directory has a very large number of
items (files, directories, etc). The number of entries is so large that you
have trouble to list the contents with C<readdir> or even C<ls> from the shell.
In extreme cases, the operation just "hangs" and will provide a feedback hours
later.

I observed this behavior only with NFS version 3 (and wasn't able to simulate
it with local EXT3/EXT4): you might find in different situations, but in that
case it migh be a wrong configuration regarding the filesystem. Ask your
administrator first.

If you can't fix (or get fixed) the problem, then you might want to try to use
this module. It will use the C<getdents> syscall from Linux. You can check the
documentation about this syscall with C<man getdents> in a shell.

In short, this syscall will return a data structure, but you probably will want
to use only the name of each entry in the directory.

How can this be useful? Here are some directions:

=over

=item 1.

You want to remove all directory content.

=item 2.

You want to remove files from the directory with a pattern in their filename
(using regular expressions, for example).

=item 3.

You want to select specific files by their filenames and then test something
else (like atime).

=back

These are examples, but it should cover the vast majority of what you want to
do. C<getdents> syscall will be more effective because it will not call
C<stat> of each of those files before returning the information to you. That
means, you will have the opportunity to filter whatever you need and then call
C<stat> if you really need.

I came up at C<getdents> after researching about "how to remove million of
files". After a while I reached an C program example that uses C<getdents> to
print the filenames under the directory. By using it, I was able to cleanup
directories with thousands (or even millions) of files in a couple of minutes,
instead of many hours.

This module is a Perl implementation of that.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

The sub C<getdents> and C<getdents_safe> are exported on demand.

=cut

our @EXPORT_OK = qw(getdents getdents_safe);

=head2 getdents

Expects the complete path to the directory as a parameter.

Returns an array reference with all files inside that directory but without the
'dot' files.

Meanwhile simple (and probably faster), you should be careful regarding memory
restrictions when using this functions.

If you have too many files, you program may try to allocate too much memory,
with all the undesired effects. See C<getdents_safe>.

=cut

sub getdents {
    my $dir = shift;
    confess "directory $dir is not available" unless ( -d $dir );
    sysopen( my $fd, $dir, O_RDONLY | O_DIRECTORY );
    my @items;

    while (1) {
        my $buf = "\0" x BUF_SIZE;
        my $read = syscall( SYS_getdents, fileno($fd), $buf, BUF_SIZE );

        if ( ( $read == -1 ) and ( $! != 0 ) ) {
            confess "failed to syscall getdents: $!";
        }

        last if ( $read == 0 );

        while ( $read != 0 ) {
            my ( $ino, $off, $len, $name ) = unpack( "L!L!SZ*", $buf );
            push( @items, $name );
            substr( $buf, 0, $len ) = '';
            $read -= $len;
        }

    }

    # removing '.' and '..'
    shift(@items);
    shift(@items);
    return \@items;
}

=head2 getdents_safe

"Safe" version of C<getdents> because it will write each entry read to a text
file instead of storing all the entries on memory.

Expects as parameters:

=over

=item *

The complete path to the directory to be read.

=item *

The complete path to the file that will be used to print each entry, one per
line. As convenience, all filenames will be prepended with the complete path
to the directory given as parameter.

=back

The filename given will be created. If it already exists, this function will
C<die>.

This function returns the number of files read from the given directory.

=cut

sub getdents_safe {
    my ( $dir, $output ) = @_;
    confess "directory $dir is not available" unless ( -d $dir );
    sysopen( my $fd,  $dir,    O_RDONLY | O_DIRECTORY );
    sysopen( my $out, $output, O_CREAT | O_RDWR | O_EXCL )
      or die "Cannot create $output: $!";
    my $dots    = 0;
    my $counter = 0;

    while (1) {
        my $buf = "\0" x BUF_SIZE;
        my $read = syscall( SYS_getdents, fileno($fd), $buf, BUF_SIZE );

        if ( ( $read == -1 ) and ( $! != 0 ) ) {
            confess "failed to syscall getdents: $!";
        }

        last if ( $read == 0 );

        if ( $dots == 2 ) {

            while ( $read != 0 ) {
                my ( $ino, $off, $len, $name ) = unpack( "L!L!SZ*", $buf );
                print $out $dir, '/', $name, "\n";
                $counter++;
                substr( $buf, 0, $len ) = '';
                $read -= $len;
            }

        }
        else {

            while ( $read != 0 ) {
                my ( $ino, $off, $len, $name ) = unpack( "L!L!SZ*", $buf );

                unless ( ( $name eq '.' ) or ( $name eq '..' ) ) {
                    print $out $dir, '/', $name, "\n";
                    $counter++;
                }
                else {
                    $dots++;
                }

                substr( $buf, 0, $len ) = '';
                $read -= $len;
            }

        }

    }

    close($out);
    return $counter;
}


=head1 TO DO

Create C versions of C<getdents> and C<getdents_safe> with L<Inline::C> to see
if they get close to C<readdir> speed when running over a B<local> file system
(currently they are slower).
